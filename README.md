## Hollow Knight (Java) â€“ Mini Remake

A simple Java/Swing mini remake inspired by Hollow Knight. Fight through three stages with basic movement, jumping, dashing, attacking, and a soul-based heal mechanic. The game uses 2D sprites and runs in a desktop window.

### Controls
- **Left**: default `A` (rebindable on the Controls screen)
- **Right**: default `D` (rebindable)
- **Jump**: default `Space` (rebindable)
- **Dash**: default `L` (rebindable)
- **Attack**: default `J` (rebindable)
- **Heal**: default `K` (rebindable, requires full soul)

### Notes
- Assets are stored in the `assets/` folder. Do not move images or `gameScores.txt` out of it.
- If you see a blank window, ensure all images listed in `assets/` exist. The title screen should appear on launch.

### Run (quick)
From the project folder:
   - `javac HollowKnight.java`
   - `java HollowKnight`
